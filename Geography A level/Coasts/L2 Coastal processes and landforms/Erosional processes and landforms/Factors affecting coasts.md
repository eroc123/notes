- Energy level of a coast (destructive or constructive waves for high/low energy respectively)
- Dominated by erosion or deposition (depends on the type of wave too and how sheltered the coast is)
- How much human activity there is or how managed the beach is (whether there are a lot of coastal defenses for example)
