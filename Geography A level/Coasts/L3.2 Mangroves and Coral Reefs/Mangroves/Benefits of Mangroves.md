1. Provides a habitat for many species
	- Migratory birds stop in mangrove forests for food and rest such as birds which migrate from the Arctic to the Antarctic
	- Some birds nest in mangrove forests such as Pelicans and Spoonbills
	- Some species live in mud such as crabs and mudskippers
	- Many juvenile coral fish take shelter in mangrove forests from predators and get food from here
2. Coastal protection from storms and erosion
	- [[Mangrove's, Distribution and Characeristics|Tangled root systems]] above ground absorb up to 75% of wave energy, protecting the coastline from erosion and human settlements from large storms
	- ![[Pasted image 20230905093926.png]]
		- For example, in Sri Lanka during the Indian Ocean tsunami, settlements that were protected by dense mangrove forests suffered much less damage compared to those that weren't (2 deaths in a village protected by mangrove compared to 6000 deaths in a village not protected by mangrove)
	- Thick root system also holds soil together
3. Marine fishery nursery
	- Many commercial fish nurse in mangrove forests and contribute to sustaining the local abundance of fish in the region.
	- E.g. 75% of commercially caught fish and prawns in Queensland, Australia depend on mangroves for part of their life cycle
4. Carbon sink
	- Mangrove trees can absorb carbon dioxide and
