**How it works:**
- Are rocks placed in a metal mesh on the base of a cliff
	- Idea is to reduce erosion at the base of the cliff and reduce undercutting
- 
**Pros:**
- Easy to build
- Are relatively cheap 
- Long durability
- Are softer than most hard engineering techniques
- Low maintenance
- Efficient at protecting beaches and helps build them up
**Cons:**
- Reduce sediment supply down drift of the groynes, which can result in issues down drift
	- These include a thinner beach down drift, which can move the problem of coastal erosion and increase it down drift of the groynes.
- Looks ugly
