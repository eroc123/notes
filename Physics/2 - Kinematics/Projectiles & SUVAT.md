**Suvat equations used to calculate vertical and horizontal components of projectile:**  
- Vertical velocity at any given moment (t) if there's a starting velocity, e.g. if a ball is thrown upwards. [v = u - gt](SUVAT%20equations) (if upwards is taken as positive)  
- Displacement at any given moment if there is no horizontal displacement, e.g. ball thrown directly upwards: [y = ut -½gt2](SUVAT%20equations.md) (this is assuming that upwards is taken as positive)  
- Object with an initial velocity upwards, the velocity will be 0 at the highest point (where the object goes from going up to falling)  
- To get combined velocity (both horizontal and vertical component combined) use Pythagoras $\sqrt{(v^2_x+v^2_y)}= v$  
- To get direction of projectile, use trigonometry
