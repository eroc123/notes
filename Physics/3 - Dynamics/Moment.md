- Force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the line of action to the point
- $Moment = F\times d$
- Units are $Nm$ 

### Principle of moments

- If a body is acted upon by more than one force and it is in equilibrium then the turning effects of the forces must also balance out: $W_1d_1 = W_2d_2$ (equilibrium)
	- e.g. if a board is balanced on a pivot, then the turning effects on both sides have to be equal.
	- sum of anticlockwise moments have to be the same as the sum of all clockwise moments

- $Moment = fcos(90-\theta)\times d$
