momentum is always conserved

when two or more objects interact, the total momentum remains constant provided that there is no external resultant force

#### Elastic

- Momentum conserved, kinetic energy conserved, total energy conserved
	- This is usually not the case as there will always be energy loss into the environment as heat, sound, etc.

#### Inelastic

- Momentum conserved, kinetic energy **not** conserved, total energy conserved
	- Although total energy is conserved, kinetic energy is not, therefore some of the energy is lost into the environment

$K.E. = {1 \over 2} mv^2$

The rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional on the resultant force on it. The resultant force is proportional to the change in momentum per second.
