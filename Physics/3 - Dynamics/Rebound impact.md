Since momentum is a [vector](Scalar%20&%20vector), the sign of it shows the direction of the [momentum](Momentum.md)

If a ball is heading towards a wall, and we take that direction as positive, when it bounces, the momentum will flip to negative, as the velocity will become negative as it rebound.

Initial velocity - $+u$
Initial momentum = $+mu$

Assuming there is no loss of speed

$Ft = \text{final momentum} - \text{initial momentum}$
$Ft = -mu - (+mu)$
$F = {-2mu \over t}$

If we drop a perfectly bouncy ball on to a hard surface, it should rebound to almost the original height

K.E. just before the impact would be equal to the final K.E. if it is a perfect [elastic collision](Types%20of%20collision.md)

For a dropped ball, we just use our normal SUVAT equations
