- Force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the line of action to the point  
- $Moment = F\times d$  
- Units are $Nm$   
  
### Principle of moments  
  
- If a body is acted upon by more than one force and it is in equilibrium then the turning effects of the forces must also balance out: $W_1d_1 = W_2d_2$ (equilibrium)  
	- e.g. if a board is balanced on a pivot, then the turning effects on both sides have to be equal.  
	- sum of anticlockwise moments have to be the same as the sum of all clockwise moments

- $Moment = fcos(90-\theta)\times d$ (if the force is at an oblique angle)

### Fulcrum

A pivot, it is considered to be stationary and will not move or break unless stated otherwise
