#physics #syllabus

1. **Physical quantities**
	1. understand that all [physical quantities](Physical%20Quantities) consist of a numerical [magnitude](Magnitude.md) and a unit
	2. make reasonable estimates of physical quantities included within the syllabus
2. **SI units**
	1. recall the following [SI base quantities and their units](SI%20units.md): mass (kg), length (m), time (s), current (A), temperature (K)
	2. express [derived units](Derived%20units.md) as products or quotients of the SI base units and use the derived units for quantities listed in this syllabus as appropriate 
	3. use [SI base units](SI%20units.md) to check the [homogeneity](Quantitative%20vs%20Qualitative.md) of physical equations
	4. recall and use the [following prefixes and their symbols](Magnitude.md) to indicate decimal submultiples or multiples of both [base and derived units](Derived%20units.md): pico (p), nano (n), micro (Î¼), milli (m), centi (c), deci (d), kilo (k), mega (M), giga (G), tera (T)
3. **Errors and uncertainties**
	1. understand and explain the effects of [systematic errors](Random%20and%20systematic%20errors.md) (including zero errors) and [random errors](Random%20and%20systematic%20errors.md) in [measurements](Measurement.md)
	2. understand the distinction between [precision and accuracy](Measurement.md)
	3. assess the uncertainty in a [derived quantity](Derived%20units.md) by simple addition of absolute or [percentage uncertainties](Percentage%20uncertainties.md)
4. **Scalars and vectors** %%TODO: work on notes from this sub unit%%
	1. understand the difference between [scalar and vector quantities](Scalar%20and%20vector%20quantites.md) and give examples of scalar and vector quantities included in the syllabus
	2. add and subtract coplanar [vectors](Scalar%20&%20vector.md)
	3. represent a vector as two [perpendicular components](Perpendicular%20component%20of%20a%20vector.md)
