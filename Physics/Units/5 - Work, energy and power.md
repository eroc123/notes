1. **Energy conservation**
	1. understand the [concept of work](Work%20Done), and recall and use work done = force Ã— displacement in the direction of the force
	2. recall and apply the principle of [conservation of energy](Energy%20Conservation.md)
	3. recall and understand that the [Efficiency](Efficiency.md) of a system is the ratio of useful energy output from the system to the total energy input
	4. use the concept of efficiency to solve problems
	5. define [Power](Power.md) as work done per unit time
	6. solve problems using P = W / t
	7. [Derive P = Fv](Derive%20P%20=%20Fv.md) and use it to solve problems
2. **Gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy**
	1. derive, using $W = Fs$, the formula $\Delta EP = mg\Delta h$ for [gravitational potential energy](G.P.E.md) changes in a uniform gravitational field
	2. recall and use the formula $\Delta EP = mg\Delta h$ for gravitational potential energy changes in a uniform gravitational field
	3. derive, using the equations of motion, the formula for [kinetic energy](Kinetic%20Energy.md) $E_K = {1\over2}mv^2$ 
	4. recall and use $E_K = {1\over2}mv^2$
