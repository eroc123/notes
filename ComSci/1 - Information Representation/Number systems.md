### Binary numbers

For Binary numbers, the first digit represents 1, second digit represents 2, third digit represents 4 etc. The magnitude of the binary number is found by adding up what each digit that has a 1 represents.

### Denary numbers

Base 10, normal numbers

### Hexadecimal numbers

Base 16, uses 0-8 and A-F, each digit represents a power of 16

### BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)

Base 10 but each digit is represented by 4 digits of binary  e.g. 16 is represented by 0001 0110

### One’s complement

A way to represent negative numbers in binary. If a number is negative, take its positive part and invert all digits 
e.g. 0100 1010 -> 1011 0101

### Two’s complement 

Similar to one’s complement except add 1 to at the end 
e.g. 
0100 1010 -> 1011 0101
1011 0101 + 0000 0001 = 1011 0110
