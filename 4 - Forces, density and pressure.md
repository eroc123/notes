1. **Turning effects of forces**
	1. understand that the weight of an object may be taken as acting at a single point known as its [center of gravity](Center%20of%20gravity%20and%20mass.md)
	2. define and apply the [moment of a force](Moment.md)
	3. understand that a [couple is a pair of forces](Couple.md) a pair of forces that acts to produce rotation only
	4. define and apply the [torque](Torque.md) of a couple
2. **Equilibrium of forces**
	1. state and apply the principle of [moments](Moment.md)
	2. understand that, when there is no resultant force and no resultant torque, a system is in [equilibrium](Equilibrium.md)
	3. use a vector triangle to represent coplanar forces in equilibrium
3. **Density and pressure**
	1. define and use [density](Density.md)
	2. define and use [Pressure](Pressure.md)
	3. derive, from the definitions of pressure and density, the equation for [hydrostatic pressure](Hydrostatic%20pressure%20(deriving).md) ∆p = ρg∆h
	4. use the equation ∆p = ρg∆h
	5. understand that the [upthrust](Archimedes%20Principle.md) on an object in a fluid is due to a difference in hydrostatic pressure
	6. calculate the [Upthrust](Upthrust.md) acting on an object in a fluid using the equation F = ρgV (Archimedes’ principle)
