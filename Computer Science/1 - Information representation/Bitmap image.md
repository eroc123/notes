Bitmap images are made up of **pixels**, which are the smallest picture element that can be drawn. 

Each pixel has a color, and the amount of bits that the color of each pixel takes up is the **color depth (bit depth)**. 

The amount of pixels that makes up an image depends on the **image resolution**, which is represented by the amount of pixels horizontally by the amount of pixels vertically.

Each image file has a **file header**, which stores the metadata, including file size, image solution, color depth, type of compression etc. 

Images are displayed on a screen. The **screen resolution** is the amount of pixels that the screen can display, represented by the amount of pixels horizontally by the amount of pixels vertically.
