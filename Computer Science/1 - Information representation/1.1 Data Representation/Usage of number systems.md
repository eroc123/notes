### [[Binary-coded Decimal (BCD)]]: 

- Digital clock and calculator display (easy for computer to output denary display)
- Storage of accounting information consisting of exact numerical values (almost impossible for computer to store denary decimal in binary exactly, therefore use BCD)

### [[Binary, Denary and Hexadecimal|Hexadecimal]]: 

- Memory dumps (Memory contents are displayed for developing software or trace bugs, hexadecimal is more manageable then binary as it is much shorter)
