- Pair of forces acting to create rotation
![100%](Couple.md)
- The forces (N) have to be equal in magnitude
- Opposite in direction
- Perpendicular to the distance between them
- Resultant force of 0, object does not accelerate but it does turn (according to [F=ma](Newton's%20second%20law.md))

###### Torque
- Is the moment of a couple (Nm)
- $Ï„=Nm$ (where N is one of the forces and m is perpendicular distance between the forces)
