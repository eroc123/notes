1. **Equations of motion**
	1. define and use [distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration](SUVAT%20equations.md)
	2. use graphical methods to represent distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration  [distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration](SUVAT%20equations.md)
	3. determine displacement from the area under a velocity–time graph [distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration](SUVAT%20equations.md)
	4. determine velocity using the gradient of a [displacement–time graph](Displacement%20time%20graph.md)
	5. determine acceleration using the gradient of a [velocity–time graph](Deriving%20SUVAT%204.md)
	6. derive, from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, [equations that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line](Deriving%20SUVAT.md) 
	7. [solve problems using equations](Projectiles%20&%20SUVAT.md) that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance
	8. describe an experiment to determine the acceleration of free fall using a falling object
	9. describe and explain motion due to a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction
