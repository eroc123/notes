#physics #syllabus 

1. **Momentum and Newtonâ€™s laws of motion**
	1. understand that mass is the property of an object that resists change in motion
	2. recall F = ma and solve problems using it, understanding that acceleration and resultant force are always in the same direction 
	3. define and use [ linear momentum](Momentum.md) as the product of mass and velocity
	4. define and use [force as rate of change of momentum](Force%20as%20change%20of%20momentum.md)
	5. state and apply each of Newton's laws of motion
		1. [Newton's First Law](Newton's%20First%20Law.md)
		2. [Newton's Second law](Newton's%20second%20law.md)
		3. [Newton's Third Law](Newton's%20Third%20Law.md)
	6. describe and use the concept of weight as the effect of a gravitational field on a mass and recall that the weight of an object is equal to the product of its mass and the acceleration of free fall
		1. $W=mg$ 
		2. where $g=9.81m^{-1}$
2. **Non-uniform motion**
	1. show a qualitative understanding of frictional forces and viscous/drag forces including air resistance (no treatment of the coefficients of friction and viscosity is required, and a simple model of drag force increasing as speed increases is sufficient)
	2. describe and explain qualitatively the motion of objects in a uniform gravitational field with air resistance
	3. understand that objects moving against a resistive force may reach a [terminal (constant) velocity](Terminal%20Velocity.md)
3. **Linear momentum and its conservation**
	1. state the principle of [conservation of momentum](Momentum.md)
	2. apply the principle of conservation of momentum to solve simple problems, including [elastic and inelastic interactions](Types%20of%20collision.md) between objects in both one [and two dimensions ](Impact%20at%20an%20angle.md)(knowledge of the concept of coefficient of restitution is not required)
	3. recall that, for a perfectly [elastic collision](Types%20of%20collision.md), the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation
	4. understand that, while [momentum of a system is always conserved in interactions](Momentum.md) between objects, some change in kinetic energy may take place
