$$F = {m_u - m_v \over t}$$  
$m_u$  = initial momentum  
$m_v$  = final momentum  
  
By rearranging the formula, we can find impulse (change in momentum)  
  
$$Ft = {m_u- m_v} $$  
  
Therefore, by looking at the LHS, we can [derive the unit](Derived%20units) for impulse: newton $\times$ time, or $Ns$
