$Upthrust = \rho gh$  
$Upthrust = W$  
[Archimedes Principle](Archimedes%20Principle)  
  
- Is a force which pushes up on an object in fluids (liquids, gases)  
- Caused due to difference in hydrostatic force at the top and bottom of the submerged object.

- Water pressure at the bottom of an object is higher than at the top due to greater depth.  
  
  
- Objects appear to weigh less when immersed - due to force of upthrust  
$Apparent weight = Actual weight - Upthrust$  
  
![Weight](Weight.md)  
  
If $upthrust > Weight_{object}$ , object floats  
If $upthrust = Weight_{object}$ , object is in equilibrium and stays suspended in water  
If $upthrust < Weight_{object}$ , object sinks
