An object's momentum depends on the velocity at which it is moving, as well as the mass of the object  
  
therefore, $Momentum = mass \times velocity$   
$p = m\times v$  
  
[Unit for momentum](Derived%20units) - $p(kg ms^{-1}) = m (kg) \times (ms^{-1})$  
Note since velocity is a [vector quantity](Scalar%20and%20vector%20quantites.md), this makes momentum a [vector quantity](Scalar%20and%20vector%20quantites.md) too.  
- ![100%](Momentum%20vector.md)  
  
### Conservation of momentum  
  
When objects collide, assuming no external forces, momentum is always conserved  
- This means that the sum of the momentums of all the objects must be the same before and after the collision  
- There can be a kinetic energy change though, if there is a kinetic energy change then the collision is [inelastic](Types%20of%20collision.md#Inelastic%20collision%20-%20Momentum%20conserved,%20K.E.%20not%20conserved,%20total%20energy%20conserved), else it is perfectly [elastic](Types%20of%20collision.md#Elastic%20collision%20-%20Momentum%20conserved,%20K.E.%20conserved,%20total%20energy%20conserved).  
  
  
However, in almost every situation, collision will always have external forces.
